# One_Tab_Browser
How to download.

First, install the latest version of Python.

Second: Download the Browser folder. This contains everything needed for the browser.

Third: have an IDE or text editor compatible with Python.

Fourth: Open the folder in said IDE/text editor.

Fifth: Build and run the .py file.

I never said this browser was good.

I will work on getting an .exe file/ .app file.
